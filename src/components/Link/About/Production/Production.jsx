                <p className="production-text">Every dessert at Bonbons isn't just a treat; it's a reflection of a journey that began with a simple love for baking. It was the amalgamation of passion, dedication, and an unquenchable thirst for knowledge that propelled us forward. Over the years, Bonbons evolved from a fledgling passion project into the sensation it is today.</p>

                        <h3 className='production-about-title-1'>How it all began</h3>
                        <p className='production-about-text2-1'>Confectionery has attracted me since early childhood: when my mother baked sweets for the holidays, I made miniature versions of them at the same time. As long as I can remember, I have always baked something. At first, it was cookies, pies, rolls, and then cakes. I baked for my family, friends, and colleagues. I understood that I needed to learn and develop, so I took various master classes. With each skill I mastered, the number of orders increased. Until one day I founded the wonderful Bonbons store.</p>

                        <h3 className='production-about-title-2'>From theory to practice</h3>
                        <p className='production-about-text2-2'>Growing up in a family unfamiliar with the baking realm, my aspirations took me from Houston to Austin, driven by an academic scholarship at the University of Texas to immerse myself in Secondary Education. But life had a sweet twist in store. It all began with a simple gesture — offering my students a container of animal crackers. Their overwhelming enthusiasm prompted me to introduce them to the warmth of homemade cookies. The delight mirrored in their eyes propelled me down a path I hadn’t foreseen: from cookies to intricate cakes and a spectrum of desserts.<br></br><br></br>Earning my bachelor’s degree was a milestone, yet the allure of baking beckoned, leading me to the esteemed halls of culinary school. As I honed my skills, Austin's finest hotels and commercial kitchens opened their doors to me, introducing me to the world of chocolate — an art form that blended seamlessly with my creations. My connection deepened with the discovery of chocolate's historical ties to my lineage in Honduras. The Mayans revered cacao beans, associating them with divine rituals. Embracing this legacy, I invite you to celebrate life’s moments with a touch of ancient Mayan magic and modern-day dessert finesse.</p>
